# What's the fuck happening right now with my git repository ???
-> git status
# What's the fuck is different between my directory and the git repository
-> git diff
# How can I fucking update my working repository with the distant repository
-> git pull --rebase

    Why the fuck --rebase ?
        First I have to fucking explain 2 things
            What the fuck is doing git pull : git fetch + git merge
            What the fuck is going git pull --rebase : git fetch + git rebase

        As you see the fucking first command use the merge feature of git and the 2nd don't.

        You can fucking understand that if you would like to avoid useless (fucking) merges you are supposed to use the 2nd one!

        How it's fucking working ?

        Git pull exemple :

        a-b---e (e is a useless commit resulting of the fucking useless merge of b and d)
         \   /
          c-d

        Git pull --rebase exemple

        a-b
         \     ->   a-b-c-d (the base of c is now fucking rebase on b, so no merge needed)
          c-d

    What's can fucking append during rebase :
        Fucking conflicts append when the same file as been edit in 2 differents commits, you will then find in the concerned file (let's say Fuck.java) a stuff like that :
            ---- HEAD
            System.out.print("Fuck you");
            ---- ebc24f
            System.out.print("I am fucked");
            ----
        You are now supposed to fucking choose which code do you would like to keep in the final version
        The HEAD version is the fucking current version
        The ebc24f is the version of the fucking commit you are trying to apply to your workflow

        You can keep both :
            System.out.print("Fuck you");
            System.out.print("I am fucked");

        Or keep the head
            System.out.print("Fuck you");

        Or keep the version of the commit
            System.out.print("I am fucked");

        Then you are supposed to fucking add the file :
            git add fuck.java

        At any moment you can check the fucking remaining conflicts :
            git status

        Then continue the fucking rebasing (if you have solved all the conflicts)
            git rebase --continue

        You can also abort the rebasing if you got the feeling to had fucked up and then retry your rebase :
            git rebase --abort

        At the end of your rebase you are free to fucking push ;)
            git push
